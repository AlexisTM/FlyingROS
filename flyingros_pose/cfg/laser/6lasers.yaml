  # Position of all the lasers on the copter.
  # If your laser is 5 centimeters AWAY from the wall X, 
  #   the position will be [-0.05,0.0,0.0] as the implementation shows
  # To be revised. 
  # This should be *I think* Measure*Orientation-Position 
  # Located in include/flyingros_pose/laser_algorithm_functions.h
  # Implemented as: _measure*r_orientation + r_position;

  # The orientation is written (-x, -y, -z) for a (x, y, z) real direction. 
  # It means the value will be POSITIVE to have a positive pointing vector.
  # Therefore, we do not need to "reverse" all our measurements.
  # This should change but is not going to change while not needed. 
  # Implemented as: _measure*r_orientation + r_position;
  # The orientations are normalized upon initialisation.

  # Offsets are the effective offset. Example: 
  # If I measure 3 centimeters too much, I put the offset to +0.03
  # If I measure 3 centimeters too few,  I put the offset to -0.03
  # Implemented as: _measure = _measure - offset;
